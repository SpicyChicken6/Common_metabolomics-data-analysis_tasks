 instance and for that I compute a simple match score again: the sum of the differences between my sample and my reference profile    
  - Activity 2.4: Implement transformation on the input data 
    - [ ] Task 2.4.1: Implement log transformation function
      - [ ] The structure of the metabolomics concentration data should be a dataframe for the ease of manipulation
      - [ ] Define the log transformation function and use it on the data to perform the transformation
      - [ ] Generate a new dataframe with metabolites concentration values are log transformed
